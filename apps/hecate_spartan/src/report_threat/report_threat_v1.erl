%%% @doc report_threat_v1 command — a sentinel saw someone trying to break in.
%%%
%%% Every public box in this federation is under continuous attack (tens of
%%% thousands of SSH attempts a day, hundreds of distinct hosts). A sentinel
%%% watching one box reports what it sees; the sighting crosses the mesh; the
%%% other countries learn about an attacker BEFORE it reaches them. We measured
%%% the head start on real traffic: a median of 56 minutes between the same
%%% attacker hitting one country and the next.
