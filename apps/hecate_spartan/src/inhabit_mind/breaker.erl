%%% @doc What the carousel remembers between turns.
%%%
%%% The provider schedule had no memory at all. Every turn it rediscovered,
%%% from scratch, that a rate-limited endpoint was rate-limited, and paid
%%% the full exponential backoff to find out. On 2026-09-02 the fleet spent
%%% about twenty-six seconds of every turn doing that against an endpoint
%%% that had already answered 429 six times, while a fallback that answered
%%% 200 sat at the end of the schedule waiting to be reached.
%%%
%%% A 429 is not a blip. It is a statement about the next few minutes, and
%%% often carries `retry-after' saying exactly how many. This records that
%%% statement so the next turn can believe it.
%%%
%%% == What is remembered, and what is not ==
%%%
%%% Only rate limits and auth failures, because only those are properties of
%%% the BACKEND rather than of the moment:
%%%
%%%   429  rate limited  -- rest it, for `retry-after' or a growing backoff
%%%   401  bad key       -- rest it long, and say so loudly: a key that is
%%%                         wrong is wrong until a human changes it
%%%   403  forbidden     -- likewise
%%%
%%% A timeout, a 500 or a dropped connection is the moment, not the backend,
%%% and is forgotten immediately: resting a provider because one request
%%% timed out would take a healthy backend out of the rotation.
%%%
%%% == It fails OPEN ==
%%%
%%% If every backend is resting, `usable/1' returns the whole schedule
%%% anyway. A society that cannot speak because its own bookkeeping says so
%%% would be the worst outcome here, and the least visible: the alternative
%%% to a wasted 429 is not silence, it is trying anyway.
