%%% @doc The threat read model — who is attacking the federation, and where.
%%%
%%% Owns the public ETS table `threats', keyed by source IP. Each row aggregates
%%% every warden that has seen that IP: how many attempts, which usernames they
%%% tried, when, and how long we have held them in a tarpit. Two facts fold in
%%% here: `threat_sighted' (a warden saw real attacks on its real sshd) and
%%% `attacker_ensnared' (a warden held one in the tarpit).
%%%
%%% The single most valuable thing this computes is CROSS-BORDER reach: an IP
%%% seen by two or more wardens is not noise, it is a campaign sweeping the
%%% federation. That is the judgement a rule engine cannot make and a general
%%% can: we measured a median 56-minute head start before the same attacker
%%% reaches the next country. `just_crossed_border/1' reports the transition, so
%%% a general is told the moment an attacker becomes federation-wide.
%%%
%%% In-memory, so it rebuilds from the threat_sighted_v1 log at boot, like every
%%% other read model here.
